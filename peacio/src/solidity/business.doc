Introduction

International investors face challenges when investing in real world assets denominated in GBP. Currency fluctuations and risks can impact investment 
returns and make it difficult to manage risk. Stablecoins and USD-denominated investment pools are a way to manage currency risk and generate returns. 
This document will explore the role of USD and stablecoins in investment pools and provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities associated 
with using them to invest in real world assets.
Understanding USD and Stablecoins
USD is a global reserve currency and widely accepted in many transactions, including investments in real world assets. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies 
designed to maintain a stable value relative to another asset, like USD. USD is often considered the most reliable currency for stablecoins. Stablecoins 
offer low volatility, fast transaction times, and the ability to transact in multiple currencies without traditional bank accounts. Investors should 
evaluate risks and benefits before investing.
Using USD and Stablecoins for Real World Asset Investments
USD and stablecoins manage currency risk and generate returns in real world asset investments. Stablecoins allow investors to invest in other currencies 
without taking on currency risk. They facilitate cross-border transactions and international investments, diversify portfolios and offer more investment 
opportunities. Stablecoins have been used in real estate investments and USD-denominated investment pools manage currency risk and generate returns.
Investment Pools
Our investment pools leverage blockchain technology for a more transparent, efficient, and accessible way for investors to participate in currency value 
predictions. Smart contracts handle the bidding, pooling, and payout process, ensuring a seamless and secure investment experience. By participating in 
investment pools, investors benefit from other investors' expertise, access more investment opportunities, and benefit from the cost savings associated 
with blockchain technology. Investors should consider risks and rewards associated with each investment pool before bidding.
Investing in Real World Assets
Investment pools using USD and stablecoins allow investors to manage currency risk and generate returns in real world asset investments. These investment
pools are managed by smart contracts, which securely hold the investment funds and handle the bidding, pooling, and payout process. By participating in 
investment pools, investors can benefit from the expertise of other investors and access a wider range of investment opportunities.
Conclusion
Investing in real world assets priced in GBP can be challenging for international investors due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, 
investment pools using USD and stablecoins offer a way to manage currency risk and generate returns in these investments. The potential benefits of 
investment pools, such as access to a wider range of investment opportunities and the expertise of other investors, make them an attractive option 
for those seeking to invest in real world assets.
